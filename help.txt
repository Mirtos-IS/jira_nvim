we currently have two commands
we expect to have your api token in a json style file call ".token" with the pair "token : <your token>", this token file should be on the same file

--jql <query> return a list with all tickets that match that jql query

--ticket <ticket-key> return all the info for one ticket for the ticket key (like UX-445)
